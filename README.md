## Usage

- **Homepage:** Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the default "Today's List."
- **Navigation:** Use the navigation links to access specific lists, like "Work List," "Movies List," and "Subjects List."
- **Add Items:** Enter a task/item in the input field and click the "+" button to add it to the current list.
- **Complete Items:** Check off items to mark them as completed.
- **Delete Items:** Click the delete button (üóëÔ∏è) to remove an item from the list.


## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The app's backend is built using Node.js, which provides a robust and efficient runtime for server-side operations.

- **Express.js:** The web framework Express.js is used to handle routing, middleware, and simplify the development of the backend.

- **MongoDB:** The application uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store lists and tasks. This allows for efficient data management and retrieval.

- **EJS Templating:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is used for rendering dynamic HTML templates, allowing for the dynamic display of data from the server.
